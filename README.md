- 👋 Hi, I’m @lazarosgi
- 👀 I’m interested in philosophy
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to code in Python, although I don't like Python - or coding
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing, unless it does not include coding
- 📫 How to reach me ... ask around!
- 😄 Pronouns: ... obviously he/him - we don't need more than two pronouns - pronouns are about sex, not gender
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... another time
